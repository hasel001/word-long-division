The primary areas I see for improvement are in error handling and exception. For instance, it would be useful for the script to throw
an error if the user enters a non-alpha string, duplicate letters in the full set, etc. Similarly, a more verbose output would be
desirable as well. Finally, it would be very useful to have the output sorted so that the indecies and their corresponding letters
appear in ascending numerical order. Any contributions in these or other, yet unknown areas are welcome.
